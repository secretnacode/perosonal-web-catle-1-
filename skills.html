            <span>Communications Skill:</span><br /> <!-- using a span tags for designing -->
            I think one of my skills iscommunication skills
            becuase i can give others a proper information be it verbally or non-verbally.
            The only problem is i don't know if it contradicts with me being introvert,
            because i became introvert when the poeple I'm talking to I'm not familiar with.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>Adapatability Skill:</span><br />
            I can proudly say that I have this kind of skill, because I can adjust to any
            situation if I put my mind on to it. I can adjust to certain situation that sometimes
            it's terifying becuase i can cut some people off just to adapt to that environment.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>Emotional Regulation Skill:</span><br />
            I can also proudly say that i can regulate my emotion well, i can set aside my emotion
            just to not make a uncertain decision. I can also regulate my emotion so that some people
            will not be hurt of what will I'm about to say.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>Self-Care Skill:</span><br />
            I guess i have this kind of skill, because having this kind of skill is a normal thing and 
            is a must for our daily living.
            
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>Basic Life Skill:</span><br />
            I also guess i have this kind of skill as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>Social Skill:</span><br />
            I have a bit of this skill because I cannot socialize well when I'm not familiar with the person,
            but once i get to know him, I guess I can socialize myself with that person.
